        <h1>rackt</h1>
      </header>

      <p>Rackt is <a href="https://github.com/rackt">a GitHub organization</a> that was created to ensure critical open source projects in the React community receive long-term support and maintenance.</p>

      <h2><a id="principles" href="#principles">Principles</a></h2>
      <p>We believe the following principles will provide a strong ecosystem of our open source projects by ensuring they have active and enthusiastic owners and contributors.</p>

      <h3><a id="consumers-are-contributors" href="#consumers-are-contributors">1) Consumers are Contributors</a></h3>
      <p>When you start a new job, you assume responsibility for the code base.  When you, or somebody before you, imports a Rackt lib, you have that same responsibility. We are building this stuff together. There is no “core team”.  If you use our code, it is now <em>our</em> code. (Get it?!)</p>
      <p>Collaborators are added liberally by other owners and/or collaborators. They need only contribute some non-trivial commits and follow the <a href="https://github.com/rackt/rackt.github.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
      <p>This also means contributors should be consumers. If a contributor finds they are not using a project in the “real world”, they should reconsider their involvement with the project.</p>

      <h3><a id="ownership-is-temporary" href="#ownership-is-temporary">2) Ownership is Temporary</a></h3>
      <p>When you leave a job, nobody expects you to continue to maintain all the code you wrote while at that job. If the business falls apart in your absence, there’s a problem with the business.</p>
      <p>Before a project joins Rackt, it should have some significant usage in the community and multiple owners so that a major contributor’s absence does not critically injure the project. If it has significant usage but only one or two owners, new owners should be added as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Becoming an owner should not come with the pressure to maintain the project for longer than you have interest. This should encourage people to accept ownership, even if for a short time.</p>
      <p>Owners of Rackt projects can stop working on them without any guilt or explanation, just like a job.  If this makes you uncomfortable, you can either not use Rackt projects or, preferably, increase your organizations investment in open source and dedicate some time to helping with maintenance. If you use our code, it is now <em>our</em> code. (Get it yet?)</p>

      <h3><a id="os-license" href="#os-license">3) Code has Non-Profit Ownership, MIT/ISC License</a></h3>
      <p>Code on Rackt must be owned by a non-profit and have the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> or <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC">ISC</a> license. This ensures that the owners of a project can continue to maintain it regardless of corporate acquisitions and bureaucracy.</p>

      <h3><a id="avoid-burnout" href="#avoid-burnout">4) Avoid Burnout</a></h3>
      <p>The first priority in managing the issue tracker for a Rackt project is avoiding burnout. Sprawling lists of inactionable, open issues, is burnout’s most potent fuel.</p>

      <p>This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Bug reports without test cases (copy/paste-able code is enough) can be closed with or without comment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Usage questions can be closed immediately and directed to stack overflow. Owners should pay attention though, because the docs or the APIs probably need help if there are a lot of “question issues”.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Feature requests without thoughtful commentary and sample code can be closed with or without comment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Issues without activity in the last 30 days can be closed with or without comment. If this is a bug you care about that isn’t getting attention, fix it. If you’re good enough to understand the bug, you’re good enough to fix it. Remember, it’s <em>our</em> code now.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a id="gather-responsibility" href="#gather-responsibility">Gather Responsibility</a></h2>
      <p>If you have imported a Rackt lib, you can gather responsibility and be a contributor in a number of ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Answer questions on stack overflow</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Add test cases to bug reports</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Add fixes for test cases</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Write up thoughtful feature requests with sample usage</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Close issues that qualify for closing (see <a href="#avoid-burnout">Avoid Burnout</a>)</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
